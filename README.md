# GLASS_DB_visualization
GPCR-Ligand Association (GLASS) database
- All 342,539 ligands annotated in [GLASS](https://zhanggroup.org/GLASS/) where downloaded in tsv format. 
- The 1403 ligands active towards the human M4 muscarinic receptor (uniprot P08173) were dowloaded as SDF and their ID were extracted.
- The 342,539 ligands were encoded in the [MAP4](https://github.com/reymond-group/map4) space and visualized using [TMAP](https://github.com/reymond-group/tmap) using their annotated properties and their activity against the human M4 as color codes.
